                    Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), also known as Acute Renal Failure, is a sudden loss of kidney function that develops within hours or days. It causes waste and fluid to build up in the body, which can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. With timely diagnosis and treatment, kidney function can often be restored fully or partially.
